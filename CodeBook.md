# Script Logic:
The script ```run_analysis.R``` performs the 5 steps described in the course project's definition. The logic is as follows:

  1. Labels are read and formatted for the activity (variable trying to predict). These are used later with the Y outcome field, which maps the activity number with the label.
  2. Features are extracted and formatted. A subset of only the labels containing "mean()"" and "std()" were computed. These relate to the columns of interest in the `````````x_train`````` and ```x_test``` data sets.
  3. The training data and test data was read, formatted and combined. The subset of features including only the mean() and std() was used to subset ```x_train``` and ```x_test```.
  4. The training and test datasets were merged into the data frame ```all_data```.
  5. ```tidy_data``` was computed, which includes the average of each feature summarized by activity and subject. The tidy data is exported to the file ```average_by_activity_subject.txt```.

# Code Used:
   * ```readr``` package - Used to read the data (```read_delim()```, ```read_csv()```, ```write_csv()```) as data frames.
   * ```dplyr``` and ```tidyr``` packages - Used to manipulate the data frames. ```rename()``` is used to rename columns as needed. ```group_by()``` and ```summarize_each()``` were used to compute the average for each variable in the tidy dataset.
   * ```grep()``` from base package and ```stringr``` package - Regular Expressions were used to find "mean()" and "std()" within features. ```str_replace_all()``` was used to format text.
   * Other base R functions - Various other base R functions were used to combine and merge data, which include ```rbind()```, ```cbind()``` and ```merge()```.
